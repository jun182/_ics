# Introduction

Want to ensure your coworkers, who are stalking your shared Outlook calendar, knows that you are busy? 

You could create a bunch of entries in the calendar yourself, but who has time for that?

# Usage

Create a file named "apikey.google" with your Gemini API key and save it in the root folder.

If you have a to-do list, save it as a .pdf with the filename "to-do.pdf" in the root folder of the project.

Then, run the "start.py" and follow the prompts.

Import the .ics file in your respective calendar program and display it to the world.
